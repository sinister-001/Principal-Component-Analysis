# Principal-Component-Analysis

Nothing to explain more. In the previous repository I have implemented **Linear Discriminant Analysis** from the scratch. Now again the same method I have done for **Principal Component Analysis**.

Go through the code and I am open for any more new contributions or changes in that.

Happy Learning :)
